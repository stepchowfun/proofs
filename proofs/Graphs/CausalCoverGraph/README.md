# Causal cover graphs

This directory presents an original notion we call the *causal cover graph*.

Inspired by the role of [light cones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_cone) in Einstein's [theories of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity), causal cover graphs are a graphical theory which generalizes the familiar computer science concepts of information hiding, scoping, variable binding, and encapsulation.
