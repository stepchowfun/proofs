# Admissibility graphs

An *admissibility graph* is a specification for which dependencies should be allowed between the components in a system. Admissibility graphs represent access policies such as encapsulation and sandboxing.

## Definition

The nodes are the components of the system. There are two types of directed edges:

- `trusts(X, Y)`: informally, indicates that `X` can depend on `Y` and that `Y` can depend on any node that `X` can depend on.
- `exports(X, Y)`: informally, indicates that `Y` can depend on `X` and that any node that can depend on `X` can also depend on `Y`.

To make those informal descriptions more precise, the following axioms determine which dependencies are allowed.

1. Every node is allowed to depend on itself.
2. If there is an edge `trusts(X, Y)`, `X` is allowed to depend on `Y`.
   - Also, if `X` is allowed to depend on some `Z`, then `Y` is also allowed to depend on `Z`.
3. If there is an edge `exports(X, Y)`, `Y` is allowed to depend on `X`.
   - Also, if some `Z` is allowed to depend on `X`, then `Z` is also allowed to depend on `Y`.
4. No other dependencies are allowed.

## Theorems

This development contains verified proofs of the following theorems:

**Theorem (admission).** `X` is allowed to depend on `Y` [iff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) there is a path of `trusts` edges from `X` to some `U` and a path of `exports` edges from `Y` to some `V` and `U` = `V` or there is an edge `trusts(U, V)` or `exports(V, U)`.

**Theorem (duality).** Given two admissibility graphs `G‚ÇÅ` and `G‚ÇÇ` with the same set of nodes and edges such `trusts(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÅ` implies `exports(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÇ` and `exports(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÅ` implies `trusts(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÇ`, then if `G‚ÇÅ` allows some `X` to depend on some `Y`, `G‚ÇÇ` allows `Y` to depend on `X`.

**Theorem (transposition).** Given two admissibility graphs `G‚ÇÅ` and `G‚ÇÇ` with the same set of nodes and edges such that `trusted(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÅ` is equivalent to `exports(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÇ` and `exports(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÅ` is equivalent to `trusts(X, Y)` in `G‚ÇÇ`, then `G‚ÇÅ` allows some `X` to depend on some `Y` iff `G‚ÇÇ` allows `Y` to depend on `X`.

## An algorithm to validate dependencies

We may wish to check whether a dependency graph is compatible with a given admissibility graph containing the same nodes. Let *N* be the number of nodes, let *E* be the total number of `trusts` and `exports` edges, and let *D* be the number of dependencies. Then we can validate the dependency graph in ùí™(*N*¬≤ + *NE*) expected time and ùí™(*N* + *D*) space in the worst case by defining an auxiliary graph as the smallest graph satisfying:

- For every node `X` in the admissibility graph, the auxiliary graph has two nodes `X‚Çë` and `X·µ¢` and an edge `X‚Çë` ‚≠¢ `X·µ¢`.
- For every edge `trusts(X, Y)` in the admissibility graph, the auxiliary graph has edges `X‚Çë` ‚≠¢ `Y·µ¢` and `Y‚Çë` ‚≠¢ `X‚Çë`.
- For every edge `exports(X, Y)` in the admissibility graph, the auxiliary graph has edges `Y‚Çë` ‚≠¢ `X·µ¢` and `X‚Çë` ‚≠¢ `Y‚Çë`.

Then, to check that a dependency `X` ‚≠¢ `Y` is allowed, it suffices to check that `Y·µ¢` is reachable from `X‚Çë` in the auxiliary graph. This can be done with DFS in ùí™(*N* + *E*) time and ùí™(*N*) space. If we traverse all the nodes `Y·µ¢` reachable from some source `X‚Çë` (e.g., with a depth-first strategy), we discover all the nodes which that source is allowed to depend on, again in ùí™(*N* + *E*) time and ùí™(*N*) space. By doing this for every source `X‚Çë`, we can discover all the dependencies allowed by the admissibility graph. Any dependencies which weren't discovered (which can be recorded by a hash table) aren't allowed.
