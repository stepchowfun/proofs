# Proxy graphs

A *proxy graph* is a specification for which dependencies should be allowed between components in a system. Proxy graphs can encode patterns such as encapsulation and sandboxing, and they can be understood as a generalization of [admissibility graphs](https://github.com/stepchowfun/proofs/tree/main/proofs/AdmissibilityGraph).

## Definition

The nodes are the components of the system. The edges are directed and indicate member ⭢ group relationships between nodes.

In addition to the usual graph structure, a proxy graph is equipped with two predicates on nodes:

1. `egress(X)`: informally, indicates whether node `X` allows egress from its member nodes through this node
2. `ingress(X)`: informally, indicates whether node `X` allows ingress to its member nodes through this node

The following axioms determine which dependencies are allowed.

1. Every node is allowed to depend on itself.
2. If there is an edge `X` ⭢ `Y` and `egress(Y)` holds and `Y` is allowed to depend on `Z`, then `X` is allowed to depend on `Z`.
3. If there is an edge `X` ⭢ `Y` and `ingress(Y)` holds and `Z` is allowed to depend on `Y`, then `Z` is allowed to depend on `X`.
4. No other dependencies are allowed.

Informally, `egress(X)` means `X` can be understood as a forward proxy for its children, and `ingress(X)` means `X` can be understood as reverse proxy for its children. These analogies are where the name "proxy graph" comes from.

## Theorems

This development contains verified proofs of the following theorems:

**Theorem (admission).** `X` is allowed to depend on `Y` iff there is a path of edges from `X` to some `Z` in which `egress` holds for the target of every edge and a path of edges from `Y` to `Z` in which `ingress` holds for the target of every edge.

**Theorem (duality).** Given two proxy graphs `G₁` and `G₂` with the same set of nodes and edges such `egress(X)` in `G₁` implies `ingress(X)` in `G₂` and `ingress(X)` in `G₁` implies `egress(X)` in `G₂`, then if `G₁` allows some `X` to depend on some `Y`, `G₂` allows `Y` to depend on `X`.

**Theorem (transposition).** Given two proxy graphs `G₁` and `G₂` with the same set of nodes and edges such that `egress(X)` in `G₁` is equivalent to `ingress(X)` in `G₂` and `ingress(X)` in `G₁` is equivalent to `egress(X)` in `G₂`, then `G₁` allows some `X` to depend on some `Y` [iff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_and_only_if) `G₂` allows `Y` to depend on `X`.

## An algorithm to validate dependencies

We may wish to check whether a dependency graph is compatible with a given proxy graph containing the same nodes. Let *N* be the number of nodes, let *E* be the number of edges, and let *D* be the number of dependencies. Then we can validate the dependency graph in 𝒪(*N*² + *NE*) expected time and 𝒪(*N* + *D*) space in the worst case by defining an auxiliary graph as the smallest graph satisfying:

- For every node `X` in the proxy graph, the auxiliary graph has two nodes `Xₑ` and `Xᵢ` and an edge `Xₑ` ⭢ `Xᵢ`.
- For every edge `X` ⭢ `Y` in the proxy graph such that `egress(Y)` holds, the auxiliary graph has an edge `Xₑ` ⭢ `Yₑ`.
- For every edge `X` ⭢ `Y` in the proxy graph such that `ingress(Y)` holds, the auxiliary graph has an edge `Yᵢ` ⭢ `Xᵢ`.

Then, to check that a dependency `X` ⭢ `Y` is allowed, it suffices to check that `Yᵢ` is reachable from `Xₑ` in the auxiliary graph. This can be done with DFS in 𝒪(*N* + *E*) time and 𝒪(*N*) space. If we traverse all the nodes `Yᵢ` reachable from some source `Xₑ` (e.g., with a depth-first strategy), we discover all the nodes which that source is allowed to depend on, again in 𝒪(*N* + *E*) time and 𝒪(*N*) space. By doing this for every source `Xₑ`, we can discover all the dependencies allowed by the proxy graph. Any dependencies which weren't discovered (which can be recorded by a hash table) aren't allowed.
