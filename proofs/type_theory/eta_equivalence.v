(*
  In Coq does not eta-contract terms during reduction. Suppose we had the
  following function:
*)

Parameter f : nat -> unit.

(* Consider the eta expansion of that function: *)

Check fun x => f x.

(*
  If we have eta contraction for both function types and the unit type, then
  that term has two normal forms:
*)

Check f. (* Eta-contract the function *)
Check fun x => tt. (* Eta-contract the body of the function *)

(*
  So, we can't have both forms of eta contraction if we care about confluence.

  What about eta expansion? The problem is that eta expansion is non-
  normalizing.

  An infinite eta expansion:
*)

Check f.
Check fun x => f x.
Check fun y => (fun x => f x) y.
Check fun z => (fun y => (fun x => f x) y) z.

(* A cycle: *)

Check f 0.
Check (fun x => f x) 0.
Check f 0.

(* Another cycle: *)

Check fun (x : nat) => x.
Check fun (y : nat) => (fun x => x) y.
Check fun (y : nat) => y.

(*
  To prevent this, we can disallow eta expansion on lambdas and applicands
  (terms being applied to arguments).

  So this expansion is fine:
*)

Check f.
Check fun x => f x.

(* But these expansions are not: *)

Check f 0.
Check (fun x => f x) 0.

Check fun (x : nat) => x.
Check fun (y : nat) => (fun x => x) y.

(*
  For products, we have an analagous issue with non-normalization, and we can
  restrict eta expansion in a similar way to fix it.

  But unfortunately, with these restrictions on eta expansion, evaluation is no
  longer a rewriting system, since whether eta expansion is valid would depend
  on the evaluation context. For more on this topic, see [2].

  Coq implements eta conversion for functions, but does not do eta expansion or
  contraction during reduction. Thus, we have the following in Coq:
*)

Goal
  forall (A : Type) (B : A -> Type) (f : forall (x : A), B x),
  f = fun x => f x.
Proof.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(*
  However, Coq doesn't have eta conversion for (co)inductive types.

  Eta conversion for identity types implies that propositional equality is
  equivalent to judgmental equality, rendering type checking undecidable [3].
  Eta conversion for recursive types also makes type checking undecidable [4].
  So eta conversion is incompatible with indices and recursive types.

  Types declared with `Record` support neither indices nor recursion, so eta
  conversion (but not expansion or contraction) is supported for them.

  Even though eta-conversion for (co)inductive types is generally absent,
  corresponding eta laws can be proven in many cases.
*)

Goal forall x : unit, x = tt.
Proof.
  destruct x.
  reflexivity.
Qed.
