# Conflict-free replicated data types

A *conflict-free replicated data type* (*CRDT*) is an abstract data type supporting replication in such a way that replicas can be modified independently and later reconciled with strong eventual consistency. This directory contains a formalization of this concept and proves some theorems about it.
