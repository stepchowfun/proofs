  f : nat -> False
  n : nat
  Recursive call to f has principal argument equal to
  "n" instead of a subterm of "n".

  ```

  If we were allowed to write that function, we could use it to prove `False`:

  ```
  Definition paradox : False := f 0.
  ```

  To prevent this, Coq requires that recursive functions have some argument
  which is structurally "decreasing" at every recursive call. Coq can
  automatically figure out which argument that is.

(***************************************************)
(* A brief summary of the universe behavior in Coq *)
(***************************************************)

(*
  Consider a type, such as `nat`. What is its type? Suppose we call it `Type`,
  so `nat : Type`. Then what is the type of `Type`?

  One might guess that `Type` is its own type, i.e., `Type : Type`. However, in
  a rather convoluted way, this would allow one to define a nonterminating
  function and prove `False`. This is called Girard's paradox, and you can find
  it in this repo here:

    https://github.com/stepchowfun/proofs/blob/main/proofs/TypeTheory/Girard.v

  So, instead of having `Type : Type`, we have an infinite heirarchy of
  universes `Type_i` for all `i` >= 0. For convenience, universes are
  cumulative, so `x : Type_i` implies `x : Type_{i+1}`. `Type_0` is called
  `Set`. All of these `Type_i` universes, including `Set`, are "predicative",
  which will be explained below. However, in the universe containing `Set`
  (namely, `Type_1`), we also have an "impredicative" universe called `Prop`.
*)

(*
  If `A, B : Type_i`, then `A -> B : Type_i`. This is called *predicativity*.
*)

Check bool -> nat. (* `Set` *)
Check Set -> Set. (* `Type@{Set+1}` *)
Check Prop -> Set. (* `Type@{Set+1}` *)

(*
  If `A` and `B` are in different universes, there will be some higher universe
  which contains them both due to cumulativity.
*)

Check Set -> nat. (* `Type@{Set+1}` *)

(* If `B : Prop`, then `A -> B : Prop`. This is called *impredicativity*. *)

Check nat -> True. (* `Prop` *)
Check Set -> True. (* `Prop` *)
Check Prop -> True. (* `Prop` *)

(* Here are some identity functions for different universes: *)

Definition idProp (t : Prop) (x : t) := x.
Definition idSet  (t : Set) (x : t) := x.

(* Because `Prop` is impredicative, we can apply `idProp` to itself. *)

Check idProp (forall t : Prop, t -> t) idProp. (* `forall t : Prop, t -> t` *)

(*
  But `Set` (a.k.a. `Type_0`) is predicative, so we can't apply `idSet` to
  itself:
*)

Fail Check idSet (forall t : Set, t -> t) idSet.

(*
  ```
  The command has indeed failed with message:
  The term "forall t : Set, t -> t" has type "Type"
  while it is expected to have type "Set"
  (universe inconsistency: Cannot enforce Set+1 <= Set).
  ```

  When we write `Type`, Coq automatically figures out which level `i` should be
  used. In fact, there is no way to explicitly specify it.

  Let's fix some particular universe and let Coq choose some level `i` for it.
*)

Definition universe := Type.

(* Here's an identity function for that universe: *)

Definition idUniverse (t : universe) (x : t) := x.

(* Like with `idSet`, predicativity forbids the following: *)

Fail Check idUniverse (forall t : universe, t -> t) idUniverse.

(*
  ```
  The command has indeed failed with message:
  The term "forall t : universe, t -> t" has type "Type"
  while it is expected to have type "universe"
  (universe inconsistency: Cannot enforce universe.u0 < universe.u0 because
  universe.u0 = universe.u0).
  ```
*)

(*********************************)
(* Universes and inductive types *)
(*********************************)

(* Let's define a universe larger than `Set`. *)

Definition large := Type.

Definition constraint : large := Set.

(*
  If an inductive type in `Type_i` has a constructor which takes an argument of
  type `T` in universe `Type_j`, `i` must be at least as large as `j`.
  Parameter arguments are not considered.
*)

Inductive foo1 : Set :=
| makeFoo1 : nat -> foo1.

Fail Inductive foo2 : Set :=
| makeFoo2 : Set -> foo2.

(*
  ```
  The command has indeed failed with message:
  Large non-propositional inductive types must be in Type.
  ```
*)

Inductive foo3 : large :=
| makeFoo3 : Set -> foo3.

(* This restriction doesn't apply to inductive types in `Prop`. *)

Inductive foo4 : Prop :=
| makeFoo4 : Set -> foo4.

(*
  There are no constraints between the universe of an inductive type and the
  universes of its indices.
*)

Inductive foo5 : large -> Set :=
| makeFoo5 : foo5 Set.

Inductive foo6 : large -> Prop :=
| makeFoo6 : foo6 Set.

(*
  There are no constraints between the universe of an inductive type and the
  universes of its parameters.
*)

Inductive foo7 (x : large) : Set :=
| makeFoo7 : foo7 x.

Inductive foo8 (x : large) : Prop :=
| makeFoo8 : foo8 x.

(***********************************************************)
(* Inductive types have a "strict positivity requirement". *)
(***********************************************************)

(* The following type is allowed, even though it has no inhabitants. *)

Inductive weird :=
| makeWeird : weird -> weird.

(* This "reflexive" type is also allowed: *)

Inductive weirder :=
| makeWeirder : (nat -> weirder) -> weirder.

(* However, the following is not allowed: *)

Fail Inductive bad :=
| makeBad : (bad -> nat) -> bad.

(*
  ```
  The command has indeed failed with message:
  Non strictly positive occurrence of "bad" in "(bad -> nat) -> bad".
  ```

  Why does coq reject `bad`? Suppose it were allowed. Consider the following
  function:

  ```
  Definition evil (x : bad) : nat :=
    match x with
    | makeBad f => f x
    end.
  ```

  We could use `evil` to construct the following diverging term:

  ```
  Definition catastrophe : nat := evil (makeBad evil).
  ```

  This is also rejected:
*)

Fail Inductive alsoBad :=
| makeAlsoBad : ((alsoBad -> nat) -> nat) -> alsoBad.

(*
  `alsoBad` could be used to construct a diverging function in an impredicative
  universe, as demonstrated in this paper:

    Coquand, T., Paulin, C. (1990). Inductively defined types. In: Martin-LÃ¶f,
    P., Mints, G. (eds) COLOG-88. COLOG 1988. Lecture Notes in Computer
    Science, vol 417. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.
    https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-52335-9_47

  `alsoBad` is not known to cause any theoretical issues in predicative
  universes, but Coq still rejects it regardless of the universe in which it's
  defined.

  1. Explain why Coq requires that all functions terminate on all inputs. How
     does Coq enforce this?
  2. No type can be its own type, yet `Check Type` reports `Type : Type`.
     What's really going on here?
  3. Describe cumulativity. Can you think of an example in which it's useful?
  4. Describe impredicativity. Does `Set` have it? Does `Prop` have it? Do the
     `Type` universes have it?
  5. Describe the restrictions Coq imposes on inductive data types.
