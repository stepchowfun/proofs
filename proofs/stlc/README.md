# Soundness of the simply-typed lambda calculus

This directory contains a proof of the soundness of the simply-typed lambda calculus. The actual soundness theorem is located in [`soundness.v`](https://github.com/stepchowfun/proofs/blob/main/proofs/stlc/soundness.v)<!-- [file:proofs/stlc/soundness.v] -->. The proof uses techniques demonstrated in [1].
