# Soundness of System F

This directory contains a proof of the soundness of the Girard-Reynolds polymorphic lambda calculus, also known as System F. The actual soundness theorem is located in [`soundness.v`](https://github.com/stepchowfun/proofs/blob/main/proofs_rocq/system_f/soundness.v). The proof is based on techniques introduced in [1].
