# This file is used by IDEs such as CoqIDE and VsCoq. The build system
# doesn't use this. Instead, it constructs a different version of this file
# (`_CoqProjectFull`) which explicitly enumerates all the source files. That
# more explicit project file isn't tracked by the repository, since it's
# generated on the fly.
